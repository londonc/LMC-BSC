# Bash Script Collection
Handy bash scripts I've had to write here and there uploaded for others to ab/use. 

- yum_auto_updae_cron.sh
  
  Set as a nightly cron to keep your Redhat/Centos box continually updated. 

- httpd_monitor.sh
  
  Check if Apache is running, and if not restart it. Because some web apps are just shitty and fail often.
