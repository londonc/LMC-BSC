# LMC Bash Script Collection
Handy bash scripts I've had to write here and there. Uploaded for reference and for others to ab/use. 

- yum_auto_update_cron.sh
  
  Set as a nightly cron to keep your Redhat/Centos box continually updated. 
  
- httpd_log_scan_and_ban.sh

  Quick and dirty tool for scanning Apache logs for a sketchy request/s and blocking their ass automatically with IPtables.

- httpd_monitor.sh
  
  Check if Apache is running, and if not restart it. Because some web apps are just shitty and fail often.
